/*Key Changes
Variable Names: More descriptive names for better understanding.
Const in Member Function: Added const to showInfo() to indicate that it doesnâ€™t modify any member variables.
Input Prompt: Added a prompt for user input to improve usability.
Conclusion
Your program is well-structured and follows object-oriented principles. With a few tweaks, you can enhance readability and maintainability. If you have any specific areas you want to improve or questions about the code, feel free to ask!
